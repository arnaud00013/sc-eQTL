# sc-eQTL
This repository contains the script to parse single-cell RNA-sequencing data and perform downstream analyses like variance partitioning and eQTL mapping for the manuscript [*Refining the resolution of the yeast genotype-phenotype map using single-cell RNA-sequencing*](BioRxiv link). The supplementary files "Matrix_gene_expression_barcodes_1_to_9000.csv" and "Matrix_gene_expression_barcodes_9001_to_18233.csv" contain the expression profile of the single cells. The gene reference/accession indexes are listed in the file "Table_expressed_genes.csv" and the file "Table_single_cell_barcodes_mapping_to_reference_panel_strains_0_based_index.csv" contains the single cell assignment to the reference panel strains (0-based index). In the latter table, the column **best_match** indicates the **0-based index** of the closest reference panel strains to each single cell while the column **significant_best_match** represents the same information but with missing values (NA) when the relatedness between the single cell and its closest strain is not statistically significant (N'Guessan et al., 2023).
